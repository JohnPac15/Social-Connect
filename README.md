 # Social-Connect
 ## Description 
 Social Connect is a back-end web application that allows you to build users, create thoughts, add friends to users, and create reactions to the thoughts. Also, you will be able to delete anything that you create. So if you create a thought that you don't like you can delete it, if you create a reaction to a thought, you can delete it as well. You can update thoughts and users. You can delete friends and reactions. Social connect is a great example of every crud operation you would ever want to make, I hope you enjoy it.
